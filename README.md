One group member had seen a number of emails in a professional group asking for electronics recycling locations. Finding facilities on Google is surpringly difficult, as it often mixes electronics recycling with normal recycling, and it does not show what specific facilities accept. Electronics recycling has its own set of challenges and require dedicated facilities. We set out to make it easy to search for local electronics recycling centers and filter by items accepted. The project launched in the Washington, D.C. area.

This is full-stack web app incorporating MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node).
